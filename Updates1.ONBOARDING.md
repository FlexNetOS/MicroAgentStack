## üõ†Ô∏è Onboarding: Getting Started with Micro-Agent Stack

Welcome! This onboarding guide will walk you through setting up the Micro-Agent Stack, adding your first app, and understanding core concepts like micro-agents, knowledge harvesting, and self-optimization.

---

### 1. **Prerequisites**

* **Docker Desktop** (latest recommended)
* **Python 3.10+**
* (Optional) **Kubernetes** cluster for production/large-scale
* (Optional) **Cloud CLI** (AWS, GCP, Azure) if deploying to cloud infra

---

### 2. **Installation**

#### a. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/micro-agent-stack.git
cd micro-agent-stack
```

#### b. **Spin Up Locally**

Using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

For Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

*The stack will launch the core orchestrator, dashboard, and essential micro-agents.*

---

### 3. **Core Concepts**

* **Micro-Agents:**
  Autonomous, lightweight AI agents assigned to each app or workflow. They handle deployment, configuration, monitoring, and ongoing management.

* **Knowledge Harvesters:**
  Specialized agents that continuously crawl internal and external sources (web, APIs, logs, docs) to gather new insights and best practices for self-optimization.

* **Optimization Engine:**
  Processes harvested knowledge to refine integrations, suggest automations, and self-tune workflows in real time.

---

### 4. **First-Time Setup**

#### a. **Access the Dashboard**

* Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
* Default login:

  * **Username:** admin
  * **Password:** microagent (change on first login!)

#### b. **Add Your First App**

* Click ‚ÄúAdd App‚Äù in the dashboard.
* Enter connection details (API keys, URL, credentials, etc.).
* The system auto-detects the app and deploys a dedicated micro-agent for onboarding.

#### c. **Observe Integration**

* Watch the dashboard as the agent:

  * Deploys and configures the app
  * Maps dependencies
  * Begins health monitoring and automated updates

#### d. **Monitor System Health**

* **Dashboard:** Shows app status, agent activity, logs, and optimization suggestions.
* **CLI (optional):**

  ```bash
  python cli/status.py
  ```

  *or*

  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f
  ```

---

### 5. **Adding More Apps**

* Repeat step 4b for each new app or service.
* Agents auto-negotiate dependencies and optimize cross-app workflows.

---

### 6. **Knowledge Harvesting in Action**

* The stack‚Äôs knowledge harvesting agents will:

  * Crawl release notes, docs, and relevant knowledge sources for each onboarded app
  * Analyze usage data, logs, and performance metrics
  * Recommend (or auto-implement) optimizations and new automation routines

**Tip:**
Check the ‚ÄúOptimization Feed‚Äù in your dashboard for the latest recommendations and changes made by the stack.

---

### 7. **Customizing Agents**

* To build your own micro-agent, see `/agents/README.md` and sample agent templates.
* Extend knowledge harvesters by adding connectors in `/harvesters/`.
* Policy and optimization logic can be tweaked in `/policies/` and `/optimization/`.

---

### 8. **Best Practices**

* Change your admin password immediately after first login.
* Review optimization suggestions before applying in production (can be set to ‚Äúmanual approve‚Äù mode).
* Regularly update the stack via:

  ```bash
  git pull
  docker compose pull
  docker compose up -d
  ```
* Join the community for support and to share new agent recipes!

---

### 9. **Troubleshooting**

* **Agents not starting?**
  Run `docker compose logs` or check agent health in the dashboard.

* **App integration issues?**
  Check error logs and review required credentials.

* **Need help?**
  [Open an issue](https://github.com/yourorg/micro-agent-stack/issues) or join our [community chat](link).

---

### 10. **Next Steps**

* Explore advanced features: swarm intelligence, custom harvesting sources, multi-cloud support
* Contribute your own micro-agents, harvesters, or integration templates
* Follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines

**You‚Äôre now ready to automate, optimize, and scale with Micro-Agent Stack!**
