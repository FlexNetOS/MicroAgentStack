# 🟩 MicroAgentStack – Project Onboarding

Welcome to **MicroAgentStack** (Element Ark) – an open-source modular framework for automating AI agents and orchestration.

---

## 🚀 System & Project Overview

- **System:** Windows 11 Pro, WSL2/Ubuntu 22.04
- **Hardware:** AMD Threadripper Pro 7965WX, 2× RTX 5090, 512GB RAM, 4TB SSD
- **Dev Tools:** Docker Desktop, VS Code, GitHub Desktop, Ubuntu terminal

## ⚡ Core Workflow

1. **All agent definitions** (name, purpose, version, functionality) are managed in `agent_manifest.json` in the project root.
2. **After any manifest change**, run:
   ```bash
   python3 generate_all_agent_files.py
````

This will:

* Scaffold or update each agent’s:

  * `main.py` (with FastAPI metadata block)
  * `requirements.txt`
  * `Dockerfile`
  * `openapi.yaml`
  * `README.md`

3. **Launch all agents:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
4. **Each agent exposes REST endpoints** with auto-generated `/docs` (Swagger UI) at its assigned port.

## 📝 Best Practices

* Edit **only** `agent_manifest.json` to add/update/remove agents.
* Run the generator after every manifest edit to prevent drift.
* Use Docker Compose for running/stopping all agents at once.
* Use Git for version control—commit changes to both manifest and generated code.

---

## 💡 Current Focus

* Improving automation and auto-generated OpenAPI docs
* Scaling agent orchestration and metadata consistency
* Adding/optimizing agent “helper” layers for advanced features

## 💬 How to Continue or Get Support

* **State your goal or blocker:**
  E.g. “Help me add a new agent,” “Troubleshoot Docker build,” “Auto-generate OpenAPI for all agents”
* **For advanced help, upload your latest `agent_manifest.json` and/or a project ZIP.**
* **Reference this ONBOARDING.md in any ChatGPT or support session to instantly restore project context!**
